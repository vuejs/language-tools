        **Before You Start...**

        Please understand that VSCode extensions and language tooling are very complex to debug.
        A bug can depend on the version of the extension, the version of your VSCode, the version
        of Vue, and your operating systems. In many cases, a simple description or a screenshot
        is just **not enough** for us to reproduce the issues you are running into.

        To help us fix your issue as fast as possible, you can help us by providing as much
        information as possible. This is an open source project, and we hope as a user you can
        think of yourself as part of the community and help the project improve by investing
        a bit more time into your bug reports. Thank you!

        Clear and concise reproduction instructions are important for us to be able to triage
        your issue in a timely manner. Note that you can use
        [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to format lists and code.
        We also strongly recommend providing actual code via a reproduction repo.
