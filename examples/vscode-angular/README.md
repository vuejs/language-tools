1. Disable "TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features" to [takeover language support for .ts](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#volar-takeover-mode)

   1. Search `@builtin typescript-language-features` in Extensions sidebar

   2. Right click and select "Disable (Workspace)"

2. Disable "Angular Language Service" to avoid conflict

   1. Search `Angular.ng-template` in Extensions sidebar

   2. Right click and select "Disable (Workspace)"

3. Create / Open `.vscode/settings.json` in workspace and put following setting to avoid "Vue Language Features (Volar)" auto active with takeover mode

   ```json
	{
		"volar.takeOverMode.enabled": false
	}
   ```

4. Reload VSCode
