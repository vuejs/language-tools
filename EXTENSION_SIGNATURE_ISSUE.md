# Extension Signature Verification Failed: Vue (Official)

## Issue Description

Some users may encounter the error message "扩展签名验证失败: Vue (Official)" (Extension signature verification failed: Vue (Official)) when trying to install or update the Vue extension in VS Code.

## Root Cause

This is **not** a problem with the Vue extension itself. It's a known VS Code platform issue that affects many popular extensions including:

- Vue (Official)
- GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat
- Python extensions
- TypeScript/JavaScript extensions
- C/C++ extensions
- And many others

The issue primarily affects:
- macOS users with older versions (particularly Darwin x64 20.x)
- VS Code versions 1.103.x and newer
- Users across different extension publishers

## Workarounds

### Method 1: Manual Installation
1. Go to the [Vue extension page on VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)
2. Click "Download Extension" to download the `.vsix` file
3. In VS Code, go to Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X)
4. Click the "..." menu in the Extensions view
5. Select "Install from VSIX..."
6. Choose the downloaded `.vsix` file

### Method 2: Command Line Installation
```bash
code --install-extension Vue.volar
```

### Method 3: VS Code Settings
Some users report success by:
1. Temporarily disabling extension signature verification (if the option is available)
2. Installing the extension
3. Re-enabling signature verification
